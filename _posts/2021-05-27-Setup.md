# Project Setup 

After creating a new project and enabling `billing` for it, open Cloud Shell and ensure that it points to the project you just created.
```gcloud config set project [PROJECT-ID]
```

Then, create a Python virtual environment that will be used to launch the exercises.
```
virtualenv -v env-tctf
source env-tctf/bin/activate
```

Then, clone the CTF and install its required packages
```
git clone https://github.com/NicholasSpringer/thunder-ctf.git
cd thunder-ctf
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, set up the project to run the CTF by enabling all the services and logging features required by it.
```
Enter y to turn on audit logging when prompted
python3 thunder.py activate_project [PROJECT-ID]
```

You are now ready to play the CTF! A ful list of commands can be found by running;
```
python3 thunder.py help
```


If you would like an introduction to the Logs Explorer which is heavily used in the audit levels, set up the introduction level:
```
python3 thunder.py create defender/intro
```

Otherwise, to start deploying the defender/audit levels, type:
```
python3 thunder.py create defender/audit
```

Note that deploying defender/audit may take around 10 minutes, and it is important not to abort the level setup before the resources finish deploying, as it will leave you unable to easily destroy the deployed resources and may require you to create a new project.
Once finished with the levels, be sure to destroy the deployment so that your project does not accrue unnecessary charges.
```
python3 thunder.py destroy
```
